# Stack.io #

Stack.io is a distributed communication framework for web apps and server-side
processes.

Communication among processes on the server-side is efficient because there is
no intermediate broker. From the client-side, requests come into a node.js
process via socket.io. Express-like middleware then processes these requests
to add things like authentication and authorization.

To run:

    npm install -g stackio
    stackio

Or, to run the tests:

    git clone https://github.com/dotcloud/stack.io.git
    make
    ./test_runner

...then navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

A number of stack.io examples are available in
[the examples directory](https://github.com/dotcloud/stack.io/tree/master/examples).

## Clients ##

### Webapps ###

To use stack.io from a webapp, include the script in `./bin/client/stack.io.js`
in your webapp. Then instantiate a new client:

    stack.io({}, function(error, client) {
        ...
    });

From there, you can start using a service, e.g.:

    client.use("test-service", function(error, context) {
        context.sayHello("World", function(error, response, more) {
            console.log(error, response, more);
        });
    });

If you have authentication setup, you'll want to login before using a service.

An example login using normal (username+password) authentication:

    client.login("username", "password", function(error, permissions) {
        ...
    });

You can also do OAuth, if you run the server with OAuth authentication
middleware. See `./apps/oauth` for an example.

To logout, simply call `client.logout(callback)`.

Stack.io clients also have a couple of utility methods. To list available
services, call `client.services()`. To introspect on the methods of a
specific service, call `client.introspect("service_name", callback)`.

[See the full API for webapps](https://github.com/dotcloud/stack.io/blob/master/doc/api/client-webapps.md).

### Node.js ###

To use stack.io from node.js, require the module and instantiate a new client:

    stack.io({}, function(error, client) {
        ...
    });

From there, you can start using a service, e.g.:

    client.use("test-service", function(error, context) {
        context.sayHello("World", function(error, response, more) {
            console.log(error, response, more);
        });
    });

The node.js client can also expose services, e.g.:

    client.expose("test-service", "tcp://127.0.0.1:4242", {
        sayHello: function(name, reply) {
            reply("Hello, " + name + "!");
        }
    });

This will expose the service `test-service` at the endpoint
`tcp://127.0.0.1:4242`.

Stack.io clients also have a couple of utility methods. To list available
services, call `client.services()`. To introspect on the methods of a
specific service, call `client.introspect("service_name", callback)`.

[See the full API for node.js](https://github.com/dotcloud/stack.io/blob/master/doc/api/client-node.md).

## Server ##

The stack.io server proxies requests that come from webapps and make the
appropriate backend calls. It also handles things like authentication and
authorization.

Servers have pluggable connectors and middleware. Connectors expose new methods
for browser-side users to make requests; currently our only connector uses
[socket.io](http://socket.io/). Middleware takes requests and conducts
transformations, or provides a response for the connector to send back.
Stack.io has a number of built-in middleware to handle debugging,
authentication, request proxying, etc.

You can create a new server programmatically, but for most use cases, the CLI
tool should fulfill your needs. To run it with normal authentication:

    stackio --auth normalauth --config <normal auth config file>

Or if you want to use OAuth:

    stackio --auth oauth --config <oauth config file>

This will run stack.io on port 8080.

If you want to run a server programmatically, e.g. to add custom middleware,
